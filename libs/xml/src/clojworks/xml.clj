;; pretty prints the xml data to a string according to the following
;; rules:
;;    (1) elements without children or text:
;;             <el attrib1="val1" attrib2="val2" ... />
;;    (2) elements with text:
;;             <el ...>text goes here</el>
;;    (3) elements with children follow the following format:
;;            <el>
;;                <child1>.....
;;                <child2>.....
;;            </el>
;;    (4) elements with children and text:
;;            <el>
;;                text
;;                <child1>....
;;                <child2>....
;;            </el>
;;
;; Children are always indented four spaces with respect to the parent
;;
;; xml-data is expected to be a vector in the following format:
;;    [ el_name attribMapOrNil textOrNil [ child1 ] [ child2 ] ...  ]
